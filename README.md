# IT_Infographics_Portal
Infographics portal for various IT technologies, workflows, phenomena, use cases etc

## Content Plan
Create infographics using a mix of static and dynamic content and javascript / jquery to control the animation of different objects in the infographics. These infographics will simulate how different IT technologies work, how various workflows and phenomena actually work in the real world.

There wont be anything stored in any database. Hence the whole site can be run from the GitPages frontend.


## Methodology
## Business Scope

Simple and medium complexity infographics will be free. Revenue can be generated via targetted ads.
